### Monogram Generator

A small project I put together to learn HTML5 Canvas. The user will input a 3 letter string of someone's initials, and the application will generate a monogram that can be downloaded to use in embroidery applications.

App can be seen at [https://nicholasdupuis.github.io/monogram-generator/](https://nicholasdupuis.github.io/monogram-generator/)

#### To Run Locally

* Clone the repository
* In your terminal, from the root directory of the project, run `npm install`
* After the install, enter `npm run serve` in your command line and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser
